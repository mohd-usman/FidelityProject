I have used MVVM to build this application because its life cycle aware and we can avoid memory leaks. I have used Retrofit with gson adapter and coroutines for asynchronous programming because coroutines are light weight thread and they are efficient.
I have also used picasso for loading images from the server since it is a light weight image loading library. I have used Recycler view to display data in the list for smooth scrolling. For testing I have used Mockito framework.
